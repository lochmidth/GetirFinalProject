## Tech Stack

- **Xcode:** Version 15.3
- **Language:** Swift 5.10
- **Minimum iOS Version:** 13.0
- **Dependency Manager:** SPM

## Architecture

![Architecture](https://ckl-website-static.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Viper-Module.png.webp)

In developing Getir Final Project, VIPER (View-Interactor-Presenter-Entity-Router) architecture is being used for these key reasons:

- **Clear Separation:**  VIPER architecture separates UI, business logic, and navigation for cleaner, more maintainable code.
- **Test-Driven Development:** VIPER's modular structure enables comprehensive unit testing, ensuring app stability.
- **Scalability:** VIPER's modular design allows easy addition of features and modifications.

### Unit Tests

- All of the presenters and interactors of every module
- CartService
- SwiftAsyncNetworking, GetirSDK (my own local SPMs)
  are tested.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following:

- Xcode installed

Also, make sure that these dependencies are added in your project's target:

- [Kingfisher](https://github.com/onevcat/Kingfisher):  Kingfisher is a lightweight and pure Swift library for downloading and caching images from the web.
- [SwiftAsyncNetworking](https://github.com/lochmidth/GetirFinalProject/tree/main/SwiftAsyncNetworking):  My own local package for concurrent networking. (Available documentation in project directory)
- [GetirSDK](https://github.com/lochmidth/GetirFinalProject/tree/main/GetirSDK):  My own local package to mimic the GetirService. (Available documentation in project directory)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/lochmidth/GetirFinalProject.git
    ```

2. Open the project in Xcode:

    ```bash
    cd GetirFinalProject
    open GetirFinalProject.xcodeproj
    ```
3. Add required dependencies using Swift Package Manager:

   ```bash
   - Kingfisher
   - SwiftAsyncNetworking (local)
   - GetirSDK (local)
    ```

6. Build and run the project.

## Known Issues
- When updating BasketViewController by adding or removing product from cart, UI flicks for a really short time due to collectionView.reload()

## Improvemets
- A more pleasent and seamless animations can be add for a better user experience.
- Localization for other languages can be added to be able to reach more user.
- Consolidate CartService into GetirSDK to adhere more closely to the SOLID principles, particularly the Single Responsibility Principle.
